# RS AI Platform

Offline-first trust & policy execution platform for air-gapped environments.

## What is this?
RS AI Platform is a sovereign, offline-first security platform designed for environments where
**internet access, cloud services, and third-party dependencies are not allowed**.

The platform focuses on **deterministic execution, policy enforcement, and cryptographic auditability**
in fully air-gapped systems.

## Core ideas
- No cloud
- No external APIs
- No telemetry
- No third-party packages
- Fully auditable logic
- Designed for regulated & high-risk environments

## Target use cases
- Banks & financial institutions
- Government / defense contractors
- Critical infrastructure
- Secure legal & compliance systems
- Offline AI-assisted decision systems

## Architecture (high-level)
- Policy execution engine (deterministic)
- Offline signing & authorization
- Tamper-evident audit trail
- CLI-first, automation-ready
- Designed to be embedded into larger systems

## Current status
This repository currently represents:
- Platform concept & architecture
- Security philosophy
- Early internal prototypes (not all published)

The project is intentionally **minimal and controlled** at this stage.

## Looking for
I am open to:
- Technical collaboration
- Security review & discussion
- Strategic partnerships
- Serious commercial interest

This is **not** an open-source toy project.
